# Treehouse Project 2
 Treehouse Project 2 Responsive Layout
Initial project, started with file set up & font selection.

This is hard!  Not so much the coding, but just using Visual Studio and Github.  I'm not sure of what I am doing.

I am trying to use typography in a 'not so in your face' manner.  Headings are still weighted  according to importance as in the mockup, but not so bold on purpose.  Letter spacing was used to keep readability and emphasis.

When adjusting for footer at end of layout, with final line justified on each end... my layout now has margins on the right and the headings are
no longer centered.  What changed and why?
